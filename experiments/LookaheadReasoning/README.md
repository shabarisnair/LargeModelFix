**Lookahead Reasoning (LR)** is a novel method designed to accelerate the inference speed of large reasoning models (LRMs). While traditional token-level speculative decoding offers some speedup, it is bounded on complex, long-form tasks. This is because the probability of correctly guessing a long, exact sequence of tokens is exponentially low. Lookahead Reasoning mitigate this limitation by elevating speculation from the token level to the more abstract 'reasoning step' level.


The core of LR lies in a cyclical process where a smaller, faster 'draft' model generates multiple potential future steps, which are then verified in parallel by a powerful 'target' model. A single cycle unfolds as follows:

1.  **Drafting Future Steps:** A lightweight draft model proactively generates a sequence of multiple candidate future reasoning steps, such as ${\\hat{s}\_1, \\hat{s}\_2, \\hat{s}\_3}$.
2.  **Parallel Target Verification:** Instead of slow, sequential evaluation, the powerful target model processes all these proposals in a single, efficient **batched forward pass**. In this one pass, it generates its own "ground truth" version for each step ($s\_i$) conditioned on the *previous drafted step* ($\\hat{s}\_{i-1}$), allowing it to explore multiple potential reasoning paths simultaneously.
3.  **Semantic Verification:** A verifier compares each drafted step with its corresponding target-generated version (e.g., $\\hat{s}\_1$ vs. $s\_1$), checking for **semantic equivalence** rather than a perfect word-for-word match.
4.  **Acceptance and Correction:** The algorithm accepts the entire chain of semantically correct draft steps up to the first mismatch. At the point of divergence, it appends the target model's own generated step, ensuring correctness before the next cycle begins.

This process, which replaces multiple slow, sequential calls to the target model with a single parallel operation, is visualized below. In this example, the first two steps are accepted, and the third is corrected by the target model, producing three steps of reasoning for a fraction of the autoregressive cost.

By validating entire chunks of logic at once, LR can produce several correct reasoning steps for the latency cost of generating just one. Crucially, this step-level parallelism is **orthogonal** to existing token-level speculative decoding. This allows both methods to be combined, unlocking multiplicative speedups and a significant reduction in end-to-end generation time.

## How to Use Lookahead Reasoning

Our framework operates with three key components:

1.  **Target Model:** The large, powerful model you want to accelerate (e.g., Qwen3-32B).
2.  **Draft Model:** A smaller, faster model that generates speculative steps (e.g., Qwen3-1.7B).
3.  **Judge Model:** A verifier model that assesses if the draft steps are semantically same as the target steps using LLM-as-a-judge (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct).

The following steps guide you through running an experiment using the Qwen model family.

### Step 1: Launch the Judge Model

First, launch the Judge model as a dedicated inference server using `vLLM`. This service will be called by the main script. Run this command in a separate terminal session.

> **Note:** The `--enable-prefix-caching` flag is recommended for better performance.

```bash
# Assigns the Judge model to GPU 3
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=3 vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct --enable-prefix-caching
```

### Step 2: Run the Main Experiment Script

Next, execute the main script to start the generation process. The script will automatically handle the orchestration between the Target and Draft models.

The example commands below distribute the models as follows:

  * **Target Model (32B):** Hosted on `GPU0` and `GPU1`.
  * **Draft Model (1.7B):** Hosted on `GPU3`.

You can run experiments in four different modes:

#### **Mode 1: Lookahead Reasoning (LR) - *Our Method***

This enables our core Lookahead Reasoning algorithm.

```bash
python main.py --dataset data/aime-2024.jsonl --use_spec
```

#### **Mode 2: LR with Speculative Decoding (LR+SD)**

This combines Lookahead Reasoning with n-gram based speculative decoding for potentially even greater speedups.

```bash
python main.py --dataset data/aime-2024.jsonl --use_spec --enable_n_gram
```

#### **Mode 3: Standard Speculative Decoding (SD)**

Runs inference using only traditional n-gram based speculative decoding.

```bash
python main.py --dataset data/aime-2024.jsonl --enable_n_gram
```

#### **Mode 4: Baseline**

Runs standard autoregressive decoding with the target model, without any acceleration.

```bash
python main.py --dataset data/aime-2024.jsonl
```

### Step 3: Collect Results

The results, including generated outputs and performance metrics, will be saved to a results file (e.g., a `.jsonl` file) in the project directory. Check the script's output logs for the exact filename and location.

### Reproduced Results on AIME24

**Setup:** 480 total traces (16 samples per problem) on 4×H200  
**Models:** Qwen3-32B (target) / Qwen3-1.7B (draft) / Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (judge)

| Method | Accuracy | Speed | Speedup |
|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| Autoregressive | 80.21% | 76.38 | 1.00x |
| Ours | 81.04% | 90.90 | **1.19x** |
| Ours + SD | 81.25% | 120.74 | **1.58x** |

Our method achieves significant acceleration while preserving accuracy, with multiplicative gains when combined with speculative decoding.

**Note:** Use `report_prefix.py` to aggregate results across folders with the same prefix.
